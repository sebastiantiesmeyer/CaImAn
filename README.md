A Computational toolbox for large scale **Ca**lcium **Im**aging data **An**alysis and behavioral analysis.

Recent advances in calcium imaging acquisition techniques are creating datasets of the order of Terabytes/week. Memory and computationally efficient algorithms are required to analyze in reasonable amount of time terabytes of data. This project implements a set of essential methods required in the calcium imaging movies analysis pipeline. Fast and scalable algorithms are implemented for motion correction, movie manipulation, and source and spike extraction. CaImAn also contains some routines for the analyisis of behavior from video cameras. In summary, CaImAn provides a general purpose tool to handle large movies, with special emphasis on tools for two-photon and one-photon calcium imaging and behavioral datasets. 

## Companion paper
A paper explaining most of the implementation details and benchmarking can be found at this [link](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/06/05/339564)

## New: Online analysis

We recently incorporated a Python implementation of the OnACID [[5]](#onacid) algorithm, that enables processing data in an online mode and in real time. Check the script ```demos/general/demo_OnACID_mesoscope.py``` or the notebook ```demos/notebooks/demo_OnACID_mesoscope.ipynb``` for an application on two-photon mesoscope data provided by the Tolias lab (Baylor College of Medicine).

## Installation for calcium imaging data analysis

### Installation Changes
In May 2018, the way CaImAn is installed changed; we now register the package with Python's package management facilities rather than rely on people working out of the source tree. If you have an older install, these are things you should be aware of:
* You should not set PYTHONPATH to the CaImAn source directory any more. If you did this before (in your dotfiles or elsewhere) you should remove that.
* Unless you're installing with `pip install -e` (documented below), you should no longer work out of your checkout directory. The new install mode expects you to use caimanmanager (also documented below) to manage the demos and the place in which you'll be running code. An installed version of caimanmanager will be added to your path and should not be run out of the checkout directory.

In July 2018, Python 2.x support was removed; Python 3.6 or higher is required for CaImAn.
### Upgrading CaImAn

If you want to upgrade CaImAn (and have already used the pip installer to install it) following the instructions given in the [wiki](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/CaImAn/wiki/Updating-CaImAn).


### Installation on Mac or Linux

   * Download and install Anaconda or Miniconda (Python 3.6 version recommended) <http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install>
     
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/flatironinstitute/CaImAn
   cd CaImAn/
   conda env create -f environment.yml -n caiman
   source activate caiman
   pip install .
   ```
   If you want to develop code then replace the last command with
   ```
   pip install -e .
   ```

**Performance issues:** To make the package work *efficiently* under any configuration ALWAYS run these commands before starting spyder (this is for linux and OSX but environment variables can be set in windows as well):

   ```bash
   export MKL_NUM_THREADS=1
   export OPENBLAS_NUM_THREADS=1
   ```   

### Setting up caimanmanager

  Once CaImAn is installed, you may want to get a working directory with code samples and datasets; pip installed a caimanmanager.py command that manages this. If you have not installed Caiman before, you can do 
  ```
  caimanmanager.py install
  ```
  or 
  ```
  python caimanmanager.py install --inplace
  ```
  if you used "pip install -e ." 
  
This will place that directory under your home directory in a directory called caiman_data. If you have, some of the demos or datafiles may have changed since your last install, to follow API changes. You can check to see if they have by doing `caimanmanager.py check`. If they have not, you may keep using them. If they have, we recommend moving your old caiman data directory out of the way (or just remove them if you have no precious data) and doing a new data install as per above.

If you prefer to manage this information somewhere else, the `CAIMAN_DATA` environment variable can be set to customise it. The caimanmanager tool and other libraries will respect that.

### Installation on Windows
   * Increase the maximum size of your pagefile to 64G or more (http://www.tomshardware.com/faq/id-2864547/manage-virtual-memory-pagefile-windows.html ) - The Windows memmap interface is sensitive to the maximum setting and leaving it at the default can cause errors when processing larger datasets
   * Download and install Anaconda (Python 3.6 recommended) <http://docs.continuum.io/anaconda/install>. We recommend telling conda to modify your PATH variable (it is a checkbox during Anaconda install, off by default)
   * Use Conda to install git (With "conda install git") - use of another commandline git is acceptable, but may lead to issues depending on default settings
   * Microsoft Build Tools for Visual Studio 2017 <https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/#build-tools-for-visual-studio-2017>. Check the "Build Tools" box, and in the detailed view on the right check the "C/C++ CLI Tools" component too. The specifics of this occasionally change as Microsoft changes its products and website; you may need to go off-script.

Use the following menu item to launch a anaconda-enabled command prompt: start>programs>anaconda3>anaconda prompt

   ```bash
   git clone  https://github.com/flatironinstitute/CaImAn
   cd CaImAn
   conda env create -f environment.yml -n caiman
   activate caiman
   pip install . (OR pip install -e . if you want to develop code)
   copy caimanmanager.py ..
   conda install numba
   cd ..
   ```
Then run ```caimanmanager``` as described above to make a data directory.

Alternative environments:
   * [Using experimental CUDA support](/README-cuda.md)

### Installation for behavioral analysis
* Installation on Linux (Windows and MacOS are problematic with anaconda at the moment)
   * create a new environment (suggested for safety) and follow the instructions for the calcium imaging installation
   * Install spams, as explained [here](http://spams-devel.gforge.inria.fr/). Installation is not straightforward and it might take some trials to get it right

## Demos

* Notebooks: The notebooks provide a simple and friendly way to get into CaImAn and understand its main characteristics. 
They are located in the `demos/notebooks`. To launch one of the jupyter notebooks:
        
	```bash
        source activate CaImAn
        jupyter notebook --NotebookApp.iopub_data_rate_limit=1.0e10
	```
	and select the notebook from within Jupyter's browser. The argument `--NotebookApp.iopub_data_rate_limit=1.0e10` will prevent any memory issues while plotting on a notebook.
   
* demo files are also found in the demos/general subfolder. We suggest trying demo_pipeline.py first as it contains most of the tasks required by calcium imaging. For behavior use demo_behavior.py
   
* If you want to directly launch the python files, your python console still must be in the CaImAn directory. 

## On Clustering
Please read [this link](CLUSTER.md) for information on your clustering options and how to avoid trouble with them.

## Testing

* All diffs must be tested before asking for a pull request. Call ```python caimanmanager.py test``` from outside of your CaImAn folder to look for errors (you need to pass the path to the caimanmanager.py file).

## Troubleshooting

A list of known issues can be found [here](https://github.com/flatironinstitute/CaImAn/wiki/Known-Issues). If you still encounter problems please open an issue.

## Dependencies

The code uses the following libraries
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [SciPy](http://www.scipy.org/)
- [Matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [ipyparallel](http://ipyparallel.readthedocs.org/en/latest/) for parallel processing
- [opencv](http://opencv.org/) for efficient image manipulation and visualization
- [Tifffile](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/tifffile) For reading tiff files. Other choices can work there too.
- [cvxpy](http://www.cvxpy.org/) for solving optimization problems (for deconvolution, optional)
- [Spams](http://spams-devel.gforge.inria.fr/) for online dictionary learning (for behavioral analysis, optional)

For the constrained deconvolution method (```deconvolution.constrained_foopsi```) various solvers can be used, some of which require additional packages:

1. ```'cvxpy'```: (default) For this option, the following packages are needed:
  * [CVXOPT](http://cvxopt.org/) optional.
  * [CVXPY](http://www.cvxpy.org/) optional.
2. ```'cvx'```: For this option, the following packages are needed:
  * [CVXOPT](http://cvxopt.org/) optional.
  * [PICOS](http://picos.zib.de/) optional.

In general ```'cvxpy'``` can be faster, when using the 'ECOS' or 'SCS' solvers, which are included with the CVXPY installation. Note that these dependencies are circumvented by using the OASIS algoritm for deconvolution.
